            This program is the <span><b>Python-ified, improved version of the Anisongs web application</b></span>, which further simplifies adding anime themes to a user's YouTube playlist. Instead of redirecting to a YouTube page displaying the search results, this program uses <span>OAuth</span> for authentication and the <span>YouTube Data API</span> to directly add the desired video to the user's desired YouTube playlist. It eliminates extra steps and enables immediate playlist management.<br /><br />
