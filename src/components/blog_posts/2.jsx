          Hey, my fellow anime fans! Summer 2023 has gifted us with a lot of amazing shows and long-awaited sequels. I'll keep this post as short as possible. So, let's dive right into my personal thoughts on the anime that I enjoyed watching.<br /><br />

         1. <span><b>My Happy Marriage</b></span><br /><br />

         Trust me when I say this is one the best, if not the best, romance anime of the season. My Happy Marriage spins a Japanese-style Cinderella tale with a supernatural twist. It's an emotional rollercoaster ride with its well-crafted storytelling. Just be prepared to experience all the feels and have a light-hearted anime queued up to feel better afterwards.<br /><br />

          2. <span><b>The Masterful Cat is Depressed Again Today</b></span><br /><br />

          From the first episode itself, I was surprised by the animation quality. It's on par with anime films, and I found myself hooked to the slice-of-life show of the office lady and her big maid cat (yes, you heard it right). The show offers a relaxing experience with a small hint of potential office romance.<br /><br />

          3. <span><b>Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout The Animation</b></span><br /><br />

          This show is an adaptation of a game which I haven't seen or heard of, and that's actually a good thing. It means the anime offers a new and fresh experience for me. It's not a hard-hitting anime with intense fighting scenes; instead, it's a cozy, chill series that follows the main character's adventure and desire to break free from her world and explore a completely new one, igniting excitement in her otherwise mundane life. One last thing: Every episode there's always a zoom-in scene to the MC's thighs.<br /><br /> 

          4. <span><b>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead</b></span><br /><br />

          I remember a friend who recommended this to me a while ago, and I enjoyed reading the manga. The manga was great, despite its simple premise and occasional convenient or borderline fantastical moments. The show, however, remains engaging and enjoyable to watch. While it's set in a zombie apocalypse, the horror element takes a backseat to the fun and comedic interactions among the characters. The zombies aren't the primary focus; instead, it's all about the hilarious "Bucket List" journey.<br /><br />

          5. <span><b>The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses</b></span><br /><br />

          The show lives up to its title. The MC has a crush on a classmate who often forgets her glasses, leading to amusing interactions where he helps her out. Some may dismiss it as a one-trick rom-com, relying solely on its gimmick, but there have already been similar shows before that are also good shows like <span>Komi-san Can't Communicate</span>, <span>Kubo-san Won't let me Be Invisible</span>, and <span>Teasing Master Takagi-san</span>. However, as a manga reader, I can assure you that the romance aspect does progress, albeit slowly. The unique camera angles add a distinctive touch, which I personally didn't mind, probably because I enjoyed the <span>Monogatari</span> series.<br /><br />

          6. <span><b>Temple</b></span><br /><br />

          The trashy ecchi entry on the list. This show falls into the old-school harem ecchi anime category, which, to be honest, I like. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me, it's still worth a watch. The show's humor is ridiculous and silly, but that's precisely what makes it so funny. Fun fact: The manga of this show is written by the same author as <span>Grand Blue</span> (which is also a must-read/watch).<br /><br />

          7. <span><b>Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation Season 2</b></span><br /><br />

          It's finally here! As a hardcore isekai fan, this show is a must-watch for fellow isekai fans. It's the OG isekai that set the standard for the genre. After watching the first season, I needed more Mushoku Tensei content. I immediately went straight into the light novels, which are already finished, and they turned out to be an incredible read!<br /><br />

          In the first season, it's all about the protagonist's exploration of the new world, as he familiarized himself with its workings and embraced his new life. However, in this season, the focus shifts to a more profound journey of self-discovery. He grapples with the question of what to do with his new life and embarks on a quest to reclaim his sense of adulthood (and “manhood”) once again.
          <br /><br />

          8. <span><b>Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War - The Separation</b></span><br /><br />

          Like its first part, this season includes some added scenes, which is a welcome improvement considering the rushed feeling in the manga for this arc. The animation is undoubtedly one of the best of this season. The opening theme resonates with the old Bleach vibes, evoking a nostalgic feeling. It's definitely one of the must-watch shows this season, whether you're a Bleach fan or not.<br /><br />

          9. <span><b>Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2</b></span><br /><br />

          This season is adapting the infamous "Shibuya arc", but before that, it kicks off with an arc from Gojo's student days. This part shows how he became the Gojo we know from season 1. I won't give any manga spoilers, but let me just say, the Shibuya arc is infamous for its series of events that caused a major shift in the world of JJK. The animation is outstanding, the fight scenes are breathtaking, and the visuals are simply amazing. Honestly, the show is just spectacular. I don't see a reason why someone wouldn't watch this show.<br /><br />

          10. <span><b>Horimiya: The Missing Pieces</b></span><br /><br />

          With the way Horimiya ended in its first season, a lot of content from the manga was actaully cut. Therefore, this season is technically not a sequel, but rather a collection of stories that were omitted from the first season. Although this season may feel like a less developed version compared to the first one, as it lacks some story and character development, it still remains an enjoyable watch. If you loved the first season and crave more Horimiya content, this is a nice addition to your watchlist.<br /><br />

          This season's selection of anime is honestly impressive. There might be other amazing shows that I missed and haven't had the chance to watch. As always, these thoughts are solely my own, and I encourage you to explore the shows that resonate with your taste. Until next time, happy watching!<br />
