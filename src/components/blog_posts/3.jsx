          1. <span><b>The Apothecary Diaries</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Light Novel</div>

          My personal favorite show this season. Interesting characters, very pretty character designs, and a unique story centered around the mysterious events within the emperor's harem with the poison-loving apothecary MC taking on the role of a detective to solve these mysteries. The episodic mysteries form the core of the story, which greatly appealed to me as I enjoy this type of narrative. The show also incorporates funny comedic moments, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the series.<br /><br />

          2. <span><b>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Manga</div>

          A unique take on the classic hero's party versus demon lord storyline. Instead of solely focusing on epic battles, the show explores what happens after the demon lord is defeated and the hero's party disbands. Ever wondered what happens to the members of the hero's party after they complete their quest, specifically elves who live for thousands of years? That's the central question this series answers. The elf MC learns that there's more to life than just its length. Themes like purpose, regrets, meaning, and endings are explored, showing a different perspective from a typical fantasy adventure anime.<br /><br />

          3. <span><b>Shangri-La Frontier</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Manga</div>

          Dark horse this season? There was no hype for this series and I had zero idea what to expect. I decided to check out the first episode and was hooked, immediately diving into the manga. The plot essentially revolves around a hardcore gamer trying to beat a tough god-tier game. What makes SLF stand out from similar shows is that it actually uses the 'video game' theme. The virtual world actually has lore and a realistic player base <i>(minus the toxic players)</i>. The MC doesn't have to fight for his life over a game; he's just your typical hardcore gamer with normal stats facing challenges and overcoming them by using the skills and experience he gained from playing a lot of games.<br /><br />

          4. <span><b>Undead Unluck</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Manga</div>

          A very weird and fun show. A guy cutting off his limbs and spewing blood at an extremely high speed to fly, and a girl summoning a meteor by touching someone. The first episode was a wild ride from start to finish, and it was a lot of fun to watch. I was also hooked on this series just after the first episode and immediately dove into the manga, and it did not disappoint <i>(a lot of really really great stuff ahead)</i>. A very solid, quirky, and super over-the-top shounen anime.<br /><br />

          5. <span><b>The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You</b></span>

          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Manga</div>

          Chad-ano is finally here, the ultimate gigachad paired with the ultimate harem. Got rejected for the 100th time and took it like a champ, was told that he has a hundred "soulmates", and confessed to by not one but two girls, all in the very first episode. The show is a goldmine of harem parody. Based on the OP, there will only be 5 girls for this season; who knows how long it'll take to reach a hundred. I don't think the manga is even close to halfway there yet.<br /><br />

          6. <span><b>The Eminence in Shadow Season 2</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Light Novel</div>

          Mr. <s>I am Atomic</s> <s>Shadow</s> <s>Mundane Man</s> <s>Fancy Bandit Slayer</s> John Smith is back. This season is a solid continuation of the previous season, retaining the mix of humor and thrilling action that made the first season really good. The waifus, the plot, and that extra 'PLOT' factor? Amazing. Personally, I'm just happy that there are a lot of Delta scenes just in the first few episodes of the season.<br /><br />

          7. <span><b>Spy x Family Season 2</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Manga</div>

          The "family" anime that took the storm last year has returned. The amount of Anya cosplays and memes I've come across in the past year is absurd. This season continues to blend Anya's charming antics, occasional action-packed scenes, and family dynamics, just like in the previous season. Crossing my fingers for more Nightfall screentime this season.<br /><br />

          8. <span><b>Goblin Slayer Season 2</b></span>
         
          <div className='source-material'>Source Material: Light Novel</div>

          The controversial dark fantasy anime after its solid first season and movie, which I didn't know the series even had, is also back. Mr. Goblin Slayer is still a simple man with a simple purpose â€“ to slay goblins, but I think there's more to his character waiting to be revealed <i>(this season maybe?)</i> Gore? Check. New interesting characters? Check. Occasional funny moments? Check. Good show? Check. I've been interested in reading the light novel after I watched the movie to see if there changes in the anime from the source but delayed it for quite a while now. I'll probably finally start it once the show finishes.<br /><br /><br />

          I was really surprised to see so many new and interesting shows this season. I've been looking forward to <span>Apothecary Diaries</span>, <span>Frieren</span>, and <span>100 Girlfriends</span> for a long time now, and I'm happy to see that their adaptations turned out well. <span>SLF</span> and <span>Undead Unluck</span> were unexpected lucky finds because I didn't know anything about them before. And as for the sequels, all three are solid follow-ups to their previous seasons, and I'm enjoying watching them just as much as I did in their previous seasons.<br /><br />
